# Unit Testing using Mocha & Chai
### Assignment #19  

I'm using my full stack Bamazon app fo this assignment.  You will need to create a local DB called:  `bamazon_test`   

Run the `test.js` file for back end testing, and inside of the js\tests\dom folder open the `setDomTest.html` file to test the front end.
